What is art ? I often asked myself that question, when I was literally 7 years old. In my school, art was drawing and painting. But my friend showed me that it wasn't just limited to drawing and painting, art is actually how you express yourself.

#### Expressing yourself

We as a human have invented few different ways of expressing our thoughts. Obvious one is speaking, which is basically making sounds with mouth, we call it language. In a day to day conversation regarding eating, sleeping, etc. or we can also call it communicating about basic human needs, our language system does the job. But when it comes to "Creativity" language lacks a few dimentions.

If a painter wants to capture the moment he felt when the first sunshine hits a dew drop, the painter must find the perfect color combination, that combination I believe comes from pre-visualization. Pre-visualization is the key to unlock the maximum output during the kickstart of a painting. So two or three layer of abstraction needs to happen in your mind. And the quality of creating those abstractions depends on how well you absorb and store information in order to recreate or create a brand new composition in your mind. Thus you get one step closer to express yourself through a painting.

If a programmer wants to express his ideas, he must do his due diligence first, his system requirements, system design, system architecture design all of that needs to be done first as a part of pre-visualization.

If One wants to train the brain muscle responsible for self-expression, art is the perfect instrument. Paint, craft a mug with clay, all of these activities enables you to think before your action. But not only limited to that because concurrently you are organizing your thoughts so that the execution of ideas happen in an order.

In the Age of AI it's important to invest into art, so that you don't lose your thinking muscle.
