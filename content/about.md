I’m Emran

I’m an expert in Enterprise Software Design and Development, and I’m happiest when I’m building open-source projects that actually solve real problems. I’ve always had a soft spot for arts and crafts too. Ever since I was a kid, computers fascinated me, but I couldn’t stand how they looked or felt. That frustration eventually turned into a mission. I wanted to change how designers think about software and how software makers think about design. So now I push myself and the teams I work with to break the usual patterns and create products that feel fresh, thoughtful and built for the future.
